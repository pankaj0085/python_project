# DIWALI SALES💰 DATA ANALYSIS 🧐
The project's foundation was the raw transaction data, which required a robust preprocessing pipeline. This was accomplished using a Python-to-Excel workflow.Python, primarily within a Jupyter Notebook environment, served as the essential data cleaning and transformation engine.4 This phase involved crucial steps such as dropping irrelevant and entirely null columns (Status, unnamed1), handling missing values in the critical Amount field, and converting the Amount data type to integer to ensure accurate financial aggregation.5 This Python-driven cleanliness was paramount to the fidelity of the final report.Following the cleaning stage, the processed data was migrated to Microsoft Excel. Excel's capability for creating Pivot Tables was leveraged to perform rapid, multi-dimensional analysis, aggregating total sales ($\sim\text{INR } 106.25 \text{ million}$) and order counts ($\sim 28,000$). The final Excel Dashboard served as the visual report, transforming complex data aggregates into clear charts and visualizations that highlighted market trends across key demographic and product dimensions.


## Project Overview 📊
The primary goal of this project is to analyze sales performance during the Diwali festival period to understand customer purchasing behavior and optimize future marketing and inventory strategies. The analysis focused on identifying high-value customer segments based on Gender, Marital Status, Age Group, State, and Occupation, alongside the best-selling Product Categories.The total sales amount analyzed after cleaning is approximately $\text{INR } 106.25 \text{ million}$ across approximately $28,000$ orders.

## Tools Used 🛠
1. PYTHON
2. MICROSOFT EXCEL (for reporting)

## Key Analytical Insights 💡
The analysis yielded clear and significant insights into the Diwali consumer landscape:
1. Dominance of the Female Demographic 👩‍💻

   The most striking finding is the overwhelming spending power of the female customer segment. Females accounted for over $70\%$ of the total sales amount ($\sim\text{INR } 74.34 \text{ million}$), far surpassing the male contribution. This confirms that women are the primary purchasing decision-makers during the festive season.
2. High-Value Customer Profile 🎯

    The most active and volume-driving segment is the 6$26-35$ age group, which generated the highest number of orders (7$11,395$).8 Furthermore, the Unmarried segment (Marital Status $=0$) drove the highest total revenue ($\sim\text{INR } 62.13 \text{ million}$). When cross-referenced with occupation, customers in the IT Sector, Healthcare, and Aviation led the spending charts, indicating a strong correlation between high disposable income and festival purchases.

3. Geographical and Product Focus 🛍️

   Geographically, sales are heavily concentrated in the Northern and Western regions. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka emerged as the top three states by sales amount, making them the primary markets for sales efforts. In terms of product categories, the market is gift and consumption-oriented: Food was the undisputed top seller, followed by high demand for Clothing & Apparel and Electronics & Gadgets, confirming these three categories are the critical inventory focus for maximizing festival revenue.


## Conclusion ✅
The project successfully mapped the ideal customer profile for Diwali sales: a young, unmarried woman (Age 26-35) residing in the major Northern and Western states (UP, Maharashtra), typically working in a high-income field such as IT or Healthcare.The festival's focus is on Consumables and Gifts, evidenced by the dominance of the Food, Clothing & Apparel, and Electronics categories. Future sales campaigns should hyper-focus on the female demographic ($26-35$) in key states and prioritize inventory stocking for the top three product categories to maximize revenue during the next festive season.


## Strategic Recommendation 🎯
The strategic recommendation is clear: future marketing budgets and inventory allocations must be hyper-targeted toward this high-spending female segment across the top three geographical states. By prioritizing these customer demographics and ensuring deep stock in the leading product categories, businesses can significantly enhance sales efficiency and revenue capture in subsequent festival cycles.
